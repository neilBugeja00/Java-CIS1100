\section{Heterogeneous Circular Queue}

\subsection{Construction of CQueue}
In this section a circular queue of size 20 nodes must be created. An integer called 'CIRCULAR\_QUEUE\_SIZE' is created and given the value 20. This is done so that the queue's size is stored in one location and should it need to be changed this can easily be done. \\
\\Firstly, in the Node class, two methods were created called 'getNext' and 'setNext'. These getters and setters are used below to enable the program to both get and set the pointer of the node it is given.\\
\\Secondly, a for loop is created that repeats for 'CIRCULAR\_QUEUE\_SIZE' times. In every iteration of this loop a new node is created with value null. To create this new node a method addNode is created.\\
addNode will first check whether the root is null or not. If the root is indead null, this means that the node to be implemented is the first and therefore must be classified as being the root. However, if this is not the case, the root's next will change to point towards the current node, and the current node's change will change to point towards the root. The loop will traverse the queue until it reaches the last node, guaranteeing that the queue will be circular.\\
\\The below diagram may help better illustrate what was explained above:

By the means of the addNode method, a circular queue is successfully created of size 'CIRCULAR\_QUEUE\_SIZE'.

\subsection{Method boolean put(AnyClass newObj)}
This method makes use of the same principles and ideas used to create the queue itself. Firstly, in the node class two methods are created which will be used to get data from a node and set data to a node.
\\Secondly, in the CQueue class, the method '\emph{put}' is created. Like the method '\emph{addNode}', it will first check if the root of the queue is null. If this is the case the root is simply filled with data by using the setter. However, if the root is not null the program will traverse the queue as it has done in the previous method to create the nodes, but this time while it is visiting a node it will set data into it.\\
\\If neither of these cases are met the method will return false, indicating that the queue is full.

\subsection{void listAll()}
To list all the data in the circular queue, this method will traverse by the same method that it has been doing beforehand. The only difference is that every time a node that is filled with data is encountered, it gets the data and outputs it for the user to see. By the end of the method all the data in the queue will be displayed.\\

\subsection{AnyClass editObject(String key)}
This method will once again begin by traversing the entire queue. If it encounters an array with data it will check to see if it matches with the key that the user wishes to edit.
